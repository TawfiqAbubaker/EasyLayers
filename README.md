# Description

Easylayers is an After Effects plugin I coded. It sold 1000+ copies since early 2021. 
The plugin lets you: 
- Create personalisable Adjustment layers trimmed to the clip's length.
- Create 2d and 3d nulls, trimmed to the clips selected with the relevant keyframes placed.
- Add solids, trimmed to the clip's length.
- Twixtor button which reduces the time needed to apply **Twixtor** to a clip from about 3 minutes per clip to  30 seconds, reducing the process time by 80% on average.

# Background 

In late 2020, I had started getting very invested in video editing, my knowledge in programming was also limited very limited since I only knew python at the time. 

As a video editor, I was very annoyed with the process of removing dead frames to apply Twixtor to  clips, it was very repetitive and unecessary so I felt like I had to do something about it.  

I went ahead and learned how to make Plugins with Adobe Extendscript using Adobe's pdf documentation, as well as [this website](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/). The documentation was very limited and the community was extremely small, making it hard to find solutions when encountering issues.

After 2 weeks of trial and error, I finally had a working product. 

Initially, I never had any intentions to sell this product, but when I saw how efficient it made my workflow, I decided to do so. I spent another 3 months, carefully planning the video demonstration for my product, how to sell it and market it. I was worried that since I had a very small community of people who followed me at the time (Around 160 followers), that It would get ignored, since I lacked the credibility, but little did I know that my script would be my break-through in the editing community.

I went ahead and posted the video demo, as well as the website selling 3 versions of the script with different features (one for 4.99$ , one of 9.99$ and one for 12.99$) and people **loved** it. Ever since then, it has stayed relevant in the community even though I have not been active in the slighltest. Most video editors are still using it to this day, making it a must-have in the animation video editing community.

# Script Customization
##### Explanation : 

In the tutorial of how to install the script, provided to the user after the purchase, I gave detailed instructions on how to personalize the script. It's so personalizable that there's 1440+ possible permutations of it, not even taking into account many other settings.
The logic I decided on was to have variables, defined in the top of the file, that the user would play with. These variables were either :
- 1 or 0 values: Indicating Yes or No.
- Custom Values : Some effect parameters can take as inputs numbers that range  0-10000.
